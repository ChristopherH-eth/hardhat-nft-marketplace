# Decentralized NFT Marketplace (Backend)

The Decentralized NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell NFTs. This backend of the Dapp
holds the various scripts users use to interact with the NFTs on the front end. It also is
responsible for deploying the smart contracts, as well as updating them, on a given chain.

IPFS is used for token URI storage, and the backend is also responsible for unit and integration
tests for the smart contracts being used.
